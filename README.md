## How to Use

1. **Write HTML, CSS, or JavaScript**: MyEditor provides separate text areas for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Simply enter your code into the respective section. 
    - **HTML** goes into the `html` section.
    - **CSS** goes into the `css` section.
    - **JavaScript** goes into the `js` section.

2. **See Live Output**: As you write your code, the live output will be displayed in the `output` section on the right-hand side. The output updates automatically, so no need to manually refresh.

3. **Preview and Adjust**: Adjust the code in each section to see real-time changes reflected immediately in the output iframe. This is particularly useful for debugging or experimenting with web code snippets.
